author=sherry kisilu
1. Introduction
This project is about a recipe library that was started by five teenagers who were learning to cook before college. They came together to try new recipes separately and increase the amount they can learn in a short period of time. Each of them would cook in their house and write a postcard of the recipe that had the procedure, review, and picture of the recipe. Once they got to college, they realized that most students had the same problem hence decided to open their library to more people increasing the numbers to at least 1000.
